Deep Learning Project: Autonomous Car with CNN
I am excited to present my latest deep learning project: an Autonomous Car developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This repository showcases the culmination of my efforts in training an advanced model to predict steering angles based on input images, enabling the car to drive autonomously.

Project Highlights
Implemented a state-of-the-art CNN model to enable autonomous driving.
Utilized the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer app for practical hands-on experience.
Trained the model with meticulously labeled steering angle data for accurate predictions.
Demonstrated the car's ability to analyze its surroundings and make informed decisions.
Successfully navigated diverse road conditions autonomously.
